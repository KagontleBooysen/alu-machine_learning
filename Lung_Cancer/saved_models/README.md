In optimizing the neural network for the project, several key parameters were carefully considered and tuned to enhance model performance. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) was employed with a learning rate of 0.01 to balance convergence speed and stability during training. A batch size of 32 was chosen for the Mini-Batch Gradient Descent to ensure computational efficiency and stable model updates. Learning rate scheduling was implemented with a time-based decay strategy, reducing the learning rate after 15 epochs to fine-tune convergence. Adaptive Learning Rate Methods, specifically Adam, featured a learning rate of 0.01, Beta1 of 0.9, Beta2 of 0.999, and an epsilon value of 1e-8, providing stability and effective adaptation during training. L2 regularization with a lambda value of 0.01 was utilized for regularization purposes, preventing overfitting by penalizing large weights. Dropout, with a rate of 0.5, was implemented to further prevent overfitting by randomly dropping neurons during training. Early stopping, set with a patience of 5 epochs, helped balance training time and prevent overfitting by halting when no improvement was observed. The parameter tuning process involved grid search, random search, and cross-validation, ensuring a thorough exploration of parameter spaces. Empirical evaluation and iterative experimentation played a pivotal role, with constant monitoring of metrics guiding the selection of optimal parameter values for a well-tailored and effective neural network model.
